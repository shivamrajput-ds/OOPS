1. class and object
2 class has method and attribute
--> attribute are bydefault called and method are called by manually
3. why python is called oops?
--> Everything is pyhton is an object(data structure)
4.  Advantage of oops
---> You can create your own data type



5. End to End project(Chatbook class)

--> function vs method
--> magic method or dunder method
--> self
--> You can create attribute outside class as well

--> Encapsulation
-----> getter and setter
-----> static method

--> Inheritance
